##The Omnicycloidal Diversion
> gesture controlled spirograph
___________________

###History
This project was inspired by, and is a tribute to, the Ferris Wheel's predecessor - an amusement park ride built on the Jersey Shore in the 1870s called The Epicycloidal Diversion.

####Notes
#####2015-01-19: from zoran
- Opportunity to build interactive installation at Chabot Space and Science Center in March is exciting. March leaves you about a month and a half to get things ready.  
- STEPS:
     - Most important document is a **short list of the business requirements.** 
     - Next is choosing an **appropriate metaphor** that captures the essence of what it is you are doing. 
     - Then **build a minimal live system** with important components in place. Do you have a prototype you can reuse?
     - Once you have the live system, the cycle is: 
          1. write a test, 
          2. modify code to pass new test, 
          3. then run regression tests, 
          4. and finally accept modified code. 
- If you are careful to add important features which require special processing first, you will run into bugs early in the process.
- As for finding help, remember mythical man-month. You will take a performance hit as you bring someone else on board, which will be difficult to overcome on a short schedule.
